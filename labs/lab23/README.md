# Lab 23 - Ingress

Walk through the tutorial defined at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/ingress-minikube/. Utilize either a local instance of k8s using Docker-Desktop with Kubernetes enabled (or another comparable option like Minikube) or a remote instance to which you have permission to execute resource creation against.
