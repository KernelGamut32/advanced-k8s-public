# Lab 16 - Custom Scheduler Logic

Walk through the tutorial defined at https://harshanarayana.dev/2020/06/writing-a-custom-kubernets-scheduler/. You can code your scheduler using GoLang (or a different language) if you'd like or use the Python implementation as a reference. Utilize either a local instance of k8s using Docker-Desktop with Kubernetes enabled (or another comparable option like Minikube) or a remote instance to which you have permission to execute resource creation against.
