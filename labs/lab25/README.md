# Lab 25 - Prometheus

Walk through the tutorial defined at https://devopscube.com/setup-prometheus-monitoring-on-kubernetes/. Utilize either a local instance of k8s using Docker-Desktop with Kubernetes enabled (or another comparable option like Minikube) or a remote instance to which you have permission to execute resource creation against.
